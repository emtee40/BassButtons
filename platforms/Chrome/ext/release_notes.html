<h1>The Bass Buttons for Chrome Release Notes</h1>

<p>Wow. It's been years since there was an update to this app. Thanks to those of you who emailed to say that
    many of the streams had gone non-functional. In the future feel free to email me at
    <a href="mailto:darryl@punkscience.ca">darryl@punkscience.ca</a> or head over to
the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Bass-Buttons/207606555945622">Bass Buttons Facebook page</a> to see
 if the issue is already being worked on or report by simply
posting on the wall.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that you do have to "Like" The Bass Buttons to take part, but who doesn't, ama'right?!</p>

    <h2>Update 2.1.0 - Major</h2>

    <ul>
    <li>White this one actually looks like less right out of the gates, there's been a significant overhaul
        to bring it inline with modern broswer conventions under the hood. Perhaps the biggest change though
        is that it now draws the streams from a server which I can monitor. When a stream goes dead as
        they seem to do sometimes, I can replace or deactivate it rather than releasing a new app every time.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Update 2.0.5 - Minor</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added support for .M3U based streams files.</li>
<li>Changed "Real Industrial Radio" to be "Hardcore Radio" -- sorry rivetheads, the other one was just way too unstable.</li>
<li>Fixed the stream URL for Filth.fm -- this was also really unstable but hasn't seemed to change much recently.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Update 2.0.2 - Minor</h2>

<ul>
<li>Removed message alert complaining about an exception when a site goes down. Now it just handles it gracefully and will attempt to check up on the site every few hours.</li>
<li>Fixed Extension menu icons which were not displaying properly.</li>
<li>Addition of release notes to better communicate with users.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Update 2.0.0 - Major</h2>

<ul>
<li>Rewrite to compensate for Google's new security policies and manifest format.</li>
<li>Addition of a couple of new streams.</li>
<li>Fixed a few minor UI glitches.</li>
</ul>
