History

The Bass Buttons is an electronic music streaming app for Chrome and Android. It was originally built as a simple Chrome extension but the popularity went up to ~5000 users I decided to create an Android version. Since the release of the commercial version on Android, the number of users has dropped considerably which is presently being tracked in the xls file in the root folder. Apparently people don't like being solicited. :) 


ext - The free Chrome Extension with any changes up to and including the last release. 

pkg - The initial import was simply a mirror of ext and should evolve from there. This will be the packaged Chrome app.

android - The commercial Android version of the Bass Buttons.
