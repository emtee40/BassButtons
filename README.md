History

Since the Beginning
-------------------
The Bass Buttons is an electronic music streaming app for Chrome and Android.
It was originally built as a simple Chrome extension but the popularity went
up to ~20,000 users at its highest count and I decided to create an Android
version.

An Android version was eventually released to try and help fund the development
but it made approximately $18.00 CA and the users dropped off considerably
seemingly due to the idea of commercialization.

------------------
Darryl made the project open source with the intention of trying to get some
other people involved in maintaining it. There is definitely still some interest
out there.
