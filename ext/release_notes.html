<h2>Update 2.0.5 - Minor</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added support for .M3U based streams files.</li>
<li>Changed "Real Industrial Radio" to be "Hardcore Radio" -- sorry rivetheads, the other one was just way too unstable.</li>
<li>Fixed the stream URL for Filth.fm -- this was also really unstable but hasn't seemed to change much recently.</li>
</ul>
</font>

<h2>Update 2.0.2 - Minor</h2>

<ul>
<li>Removed message alert complaining about an exception when a site goes down. Now it just handles it gracefully and will attempt to check up on the site every few hours.</li>
<li>Fixed Extension menu icons which were not displaying properly.</li>
<li>Addition of release notes to better communicate with users.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Update 2.0.0 - Major</h2>
