Welcome to my fist Google Chrome extension. As of the time of this writing, this extension has already been installed by almost ~5000 people and is in active use by over ~3400. 

This is essentially a stream player for primarily 3 forms of techno music via 3 of my favourite streams. The buttons represent dubstep, drum n bass, and techno - what I believe to be the pillars of 'bass music'. Each of these streams my favourite stations which play 24/7 online music. 

dubstep = dubstep.fm
drum n bass = bassdrive.com
techno = DI.fm: Techno
chill = Soma.fm

In addition, the extension can broadcast Chrome/Windows based notifications to users as well as provide dynamic channel updates and access to special mp3 streams curated by our server on http://www.seriousbusiness.ca.
